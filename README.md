Base Godot project using a fixed point fork of BEPUphysics in Godot Mono

On opening the project, build and then reload the project

Everything in the "-DEMO" folder is not required for BEPUphysics to work and can be deleted
-DEMO folder contains two scenes:
  A player demo scene where you can run around with a joypad, jump, and dodge left and right with the shoulder buttons
  A benchmark scene that spawns cubes continuously and shows FPS and the number of cubes spawned
